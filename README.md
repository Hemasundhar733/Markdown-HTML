# Markdown-HTML

### Prerequisites:
- Node.js installed on your machine

### Steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the repository containing the Markdown editor application to your local machine using Git:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Navigate to the root directory of the cloned project:
   ```
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install the required dependencies for both the frontend and backend. Run the following command in the root directory of the project:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   
4. **Start the Backend Server:**
   Navigate to the `markdown-backend` directory and start the Node.js backend server:
   ```
   cd markdown-backend
   node server.js
   ```
   The backend server will start running on port 5000 by default.

5. **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
   Open a new terminal window/tab and navigate back to the root directory of the project. Then, start the React development server for the frontend:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend development server will start running on port 3000 by default.

6. **Access the Application:**
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the Markdown editor application locally.

7. **Toggle Between Dark and Light Modes:**
   Use the toggle button at the top right corner of the application to switch between dark and light modes.

That's it! You've successfully set up and run the Markdown editor application locally on your machine. You can now use the editor to write Markdown text and preview the HTML output in real-time.
